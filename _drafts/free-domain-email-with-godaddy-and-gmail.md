So times are changing a bit. 

As of writing, however, you can simply use the Gmail SMTP server, as long as you use Google two-step authentication.

So just for completeness, the full steps:

Gmail settings, Accounts and Import tab.
Add another email address you own
Type name and email address to be added. Untick treat as an alias.
For SMTP Server, put smtp.gmail.com
For Username, your full Gmail address including @gmail.com
For password, provide an App Password generated in Google Accounts at https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords
Leave Secured connection using TLS selected as is.
Add Account
