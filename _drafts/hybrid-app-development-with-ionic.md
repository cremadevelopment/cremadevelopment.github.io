# Prerequisites

Node Package Manager [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

# Installing Ionic

We of course need to install ionic, and that is really easy with npm, but to build an application that uses the actual device sensors we will go ahead and install cordova now as well.  The basic get started commands are found on the [Ionic's Getting Started](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/) page. for your convenience it is `npm install -g cordova ionic`. Now that we have ionic installed an ready to go! We can quickly verify this by `ionic --version` and `cordova --version`.
