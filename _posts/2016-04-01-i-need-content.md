I have been struggling with getting a site up for a while. I first made a list of the things I needed.

- A domain name.
- A platform to write on.
- A platform to speak about.

Once I had this list I set about putting in place the pieces to make all of these things happen. Well down the path of putting all this together I stopped myself. I thought this could be the most well put together site ever, <!--more-->but without content why was I doing any of it.  There would be no reason for anyone to visit my site, let alone come back.  Related to this was that a number of decisions about creating this were arduous due to the fact that I didn't have content.

So there I was, a guy who wanted a place to store thoughts, tricks, and the passion for development. I thought I will just store my notes for now, in [Evernote](https://evernote.com) and share them later. Well almost a year later, I got the bug again and I had a wealth of topics and notes that I wanted to make public. So I dug through my notes, with such hope mind you, finding a ton of topics and some quick reminders.  With all of what I had stored I realized that this "content" did not warrant a page. All of it needed to be written out as full thoughts for consumption other than my own.

Therefore I have decided to post this, the page which you are looking at.  Though there is a high likelihood that you have lost interest and moved on to play games on your phone, or searched again and found what you needed on [StackOverflow](stackoverflow.com). I will forge on in an attempt to break the vicious recursive cycle of no site, no content, no site, no content. I will stand up a page, with little more than my blabbering on about not having content. The theory is that having a platform in place to collect these thoughts gives no excuse to put off filling in my content.

_Thanks for listening._
